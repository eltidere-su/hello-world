<p>Hi, my name is Elena Tiderencel and I am a senior at Syracuse University double majoring in Marketing Management and Entrepreneruship and Emerging Enterprises. I also have a minor in Information Management and Technology. I am currently one of the captains of the Syracuse University Lady Orange Dance Team. We dance at all of the home basketball and football games and attend various events throughout the community. We also compete at Nationals every year against other Division I schools. This has truly been one of the best parts of my college experience!</p>
<p>Dance is a huge part of my life and so is my family. I grew up in close proximity to all of my cousins. We were able to spend a lot of time together and I am very thankful for that. I have a sister named Grace and a brother name Joseph. Grace is 18 and Joseph is 13. I have two older cousins on my mom's side of the family and four cousins on my dad's side. We spend every holiday together and also go on yearly vacations together. My entire family even came to Italy to visit me while I was abroad! We made the most incredible memories!</p>
<p>I interned at Deloitte as a Business Technology Analyst Summer Scholar this summer in New York City. I loved every second of it! I recently accepted an offer to return after graduation as a Business Technology Analyst.</p>
